# Braille-Painter
braille-paint
A experiment designed to convert graphic images to the Braille 8-pin font, using black as active pins and white as non-active. It uses a canvas to import an image, then analyzes the image for its black and white pixels. 

This idea is that I'd like to see people start creating their own "Braille Art" using this conversion tool. Eventually, if the tech keeps going in the direction I'm seeing now, we're going to see full page braille readers in the coming years - and that would mean that you could support graphics like this.

Bon apetit!
